# SimPeakFit

A short and simple code for fitting Gaussian, Lorentzians or Voigts to spectroscopy data. The code is based on **lm-fit.**

Input data layout(for the case of Raman spectroscopy) have wavenumbers as column headers and a single row corresponding to one spectrum.

**Current build** includes:
- Polynomial Baseline Subtraction
- Multiple Peak Fits
- Plotting of Fitted Envelope and Individual Components
